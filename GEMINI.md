# GEMINI.md

## Directory Overview

This directory contains the files for a GitHub profile README. It is not a software project, but rather a personalized landing page for a GitHub user's profile. The user is a Computer Science student who is showcasing their skills, interests, and contact information.

## Key Files

*   `README.md`: This is the main file that is displayed on the user's GitHub profile. It contains information about the user, their skills, their GitHub stats, and how to contact them.
*   `GEMINI.md`: This file, which you are currently reading. It provides context about the directory for the Gemini CLI.

## Usage

The files in this directory are used to create a public-facing GitHub profile. The `README.md` file is automatically displayed on the user's GitHub profile page. Any changes to this file will be reflected on their profile.

## Automation

The `run_shell_command` can be used to automate the process of updating the `README.md` file. For example, you can use it to automatically update the GitHub stats every day.

Here is an example of how to use the `run_shell_command` to update the `README.md` file:

```
run_shell_command(
  command='YOUR_COMMAND_HERE',
  description='A description of what the command does.'
)
```

You can replace `YOUR_COMMAND_HERE` with the command that you want to use to update the `README.md` file. For example, you could use a script that fetches your latest GitHub stats and updates the `README.md` file accordingly.
